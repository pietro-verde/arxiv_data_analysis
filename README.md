# arXiv Data Analysis

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org) is a website created by Cornell University hosting over 2 million open-access scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.

The purpose of the project hosted in this repository is to provide some analysis on the arXiv dataset and apply Natural Language Processing techniques. 

A text classificaition with the goal of assigning the most appropriate label to an article based on its title and abstract text is performed using [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) and compared to traditional machine learning models like Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression.
