# arXiv Data Analysis

#### -------------- work in progress -------------------------

arXiv (https://arxiv.org) is a website created by Cornell University hosting over 2 million open-access scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.

The eight main subjects (physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics) are subdivided into categories in the arXiv system (https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy) and each text can belong to more than one category, although only one of them is considered as the main one within the arXiv database.

The purpose of the project hosted in this repository is to provide some analysis of the scientific publications available from arXiv.

arXiv makes the data available from an API (https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/index.html) where publications can be retrieved individually. For bulk access, a full dataset is uploaded to the Kaggle website and updated once a month (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv). This is the source that has been used for this project.
